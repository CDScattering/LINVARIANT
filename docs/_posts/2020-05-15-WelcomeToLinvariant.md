Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Python with line numbers:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def print_hi(name):
    print("Hi, {}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

C with line numbers:
{% highlight c linenos %}
void print_hi(string name) {
  printf("Hi, %s", name);
}
print_hi("Tom");
/* prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. */
{% endhighlight %}
